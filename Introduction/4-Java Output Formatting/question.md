# Java Output Formatting (printf) 🎯

## Problem
Java's `System.out.printf` function can be used to print formatted output. The purpose of this exercise is to test your understanding of formatting output using `printf`.

To get you started, a portion of the solution is provided in the editor; you must format and print the input to complete the solution.

## Input Format
Every line of input will contain a String followed by an integer.
Each String will have a maximum of **10** alphabetic characters, and each integer will be in the inclusive range from **0** to **999**.

## Output Format
In each line of output there should be two columns:

- The first column contains the String and is left-justified using exactly **15** characters.
- The second column contains the integer, expressed in exactly **3** digits; if the original input has less than three digits, pad the output with leading zeroes.

## Sample Input
```
java 100
cpp 65
python 50
```

## Sample Output
```
================================
java           100 
cpp            065 
python         050 
================================
```

## Explanation 💡
- Each string is left-justified and filled with spaces to a width of **15** characters.
- Each integer is formatted to **3** digits with leading zeroes when necessary (e.g., `65` → `065`).

**Tip:** Use `System.out.printf("%-15s%03d%n", str, num);` to format each line correctly.
