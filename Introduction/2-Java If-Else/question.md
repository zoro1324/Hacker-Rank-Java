# Java If-Else (Weird or Not Weird) ✅

## Problem
Given an integer **n**, perform the following conditional actions:

- If **n** is odd, print **Weird**.
- If **n** is even and in the inclusive range of **2 to 5**, print **Not Weird**.
- If **n** is even and in the inclusive range of **6 to 20**, print **Weird**.
- If **n** is even and greater than **20**, print **Not Weird**.

Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not **n** is weird.

## Input Format
A single line containing a positive integer, **n**.

## Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 100

## Output Format
Print **Weird** if the number is weird; otherwise, print **Not Weird**.

## Sample Input 0
```
3
```

## Sample Output 0
```
Weird
```

## Sample Input 1
```
24
```

## Sample Output 1
```
Not Weird
```

## Explanation 💡
- Sample Case 0: **n = 3** is odd, so we print **Weird**.
- Sample Case 1: **n = 24** is even and greater than 20, so we print **Not Weird**.

**Tip:** Use conditional statements (if / else if / else) to implement the logic.
